# Ferrocene_Data

The respective folders contain optimized structures used in the Ferrocene study.

All output files were from single point calculations at the B3LYP/AUG-cc-pVTZ theory level.

The sorbents.tar.gz file contains output files for all isolated sorbent molecules i.e., Fc, Fc+, Fc+/Fc-R.

The sorbates.tar.gz file contains output files for all isolated sorbate molecules i.e. As(V), As(III), and P(V).

The adsorbed_structures.tar.gz file contains output files for all systems with the respective sorbates bound to the rspective sorbents. 

All output files contain optimized geometric and electronic structures, energies and accompanying Natural Bond Orbital population analysis.
